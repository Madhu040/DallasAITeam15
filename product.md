# TruNorth — Product Context (`product.md`)

> **Living implementation ledger.** This file is the single high-level, always-current
> picture of **what actually exists in `trunorth/` right now** — files, methods,
> and functionality. Design intent lives in [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md) and the
> specs under [`docs/specs/`](./docs/specs/) (primary:
> [`TruNorth Technical Specification.md`](./docs/specs/TruNorth%20Technical%20Specification.md)).
> This file is not a plan — reality always wins here.

## Team roles & task board

Each teammate has one active to-do. Tasks come from the current gaps in Section 3
(⬜ / 🟨 items and pending work). Check a task off only when the matching Section 3
entry is updated in the same change.

> **🔧 = actively being worked on.** The folder tree (Section 2) and component entries
> (Section 3) are tagged `🔧 <name>` wherever someone on this board is currently
> working. Check for a 🔧 tag before touching an area — coordinate with the owner first.

### Ermoni — Backend (Supabase, first iteration: level images) 🔧

- [ ] Get Supabase connected to the app and storing the **level / zone images** (start with
  Level 1 / Everbright), so the app can pull the right images per
  level when needed — **without breaking** the fully-offline demo path (`?demo=1` +
  `public/assets/zones/`). Design the visuals together with Gabby, based on
  [`docs/scripts/Updated-Script-6-8anxiety .docx`](./docs/scripts/Updated-Script-6-8anxiety%20.docx) (current script).

### Gabby — Backend (Supabase level images, with Ermoni) 🔧

- [ ] Design the SVG / asset frames for Level 1 (Flicker, Wize, Nova, Star Crystal)
  from the current 5–7 anxiety script, and work with Ermoni to store them in Supabase
  and wire pull-per-level in the app (keep local placeholders as offline fallback).

### Daniel — Frontend (Level 1 content + gameplay UX)

- [x] ~~Ship Level 1 **The Singing Bridge** from Vandy’s script into playable content~~
  (W1→W6 scenes, DPs, Flicker/Wize cast, multi-tap breathe/crossing, celebration,
  insights/fallbacks/demo bundle) — done 2026-07-13.
- [x] ~~Ship world movement + environment interact~~ (WASD/arrows, collision, E/Space,
  companion follow, sparks) — done 2026-07-14.
- [x] ~~Rebase Level 1 onto the new 5–7 anxiety script, **The Little Dragon Who Wouldn't
  Stop Guarding** (Nova/Flicker/Star Crystals), and ship cross-device **Play Together**
  invites + mobile/LAN play~~ — branch `feat/singing-bridge-level-1` (PR #7) diverged
  from main before the w7 finish/Wize-Flicker-fix/stage-objects/z-layering work landed,
  so it was manually reconciled onto a fresh branch off main rather than merged: new
  narrative content (dp_\*.json, w1–w7 scenes, zones/achievements/celebration,
  coPlay/insights/fallbacks/demo bundle) replaces the old Singing Bridge text 1:1 on the
  same DP ids; **4 new grid maps** (`forest-of-questions`, `meadow-of-curiosity`,
  `cave-of-purpose`, `mountain-festival`) replace the single `singing-bridge` grid so
  the explorable-movement feature keeps working with the new per-scene biomes; the w7
  walk-to-finish mechanic, Wize/Flicker character-role split, dialogue z-layering fix,
  and speech/voice toggle from main are all preserved unchanged. Play Together (new
  `server/routes/together.ts`, `src/together/inviteStore.ts`, `src/ui/togetherScreens.ts`,
  `src/util/id.ts`) is additive on top — see
  [play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md). Done 2026-07-18.
- [ ] Next: polish Level 1 play feel — expression changes along Flicker’s arc, richer
  investigation hotspots, and optional TileMap rooms if the team adopts grid levels.
  Also: fix the remaining `npm run typecheck` errors (see §3.14) so CI goes green.
  Also: no automated tests yet for Play Together (server route / invite store / UI).
- **Files owned:** `trunorth/content/chapters/ch2/*`, `trunorth/src/engine/*`,
  `trunorth/src/input/InputController.ts`, `trunorth/src/ui/GameView.ts`,
  `trunorth/src/render/characters.ts`, `trunorth/src/content/{index,scenarios,zones}.ts`,
  `trunorth/src/together/*`, `trunorth/src/ui/togetherScreens.ts`.

### Jose — Frontend (deployment) 🔧

- [ ] Deploy the app so users can play and test it: stand up a hosted environment
  for the **Vite client + Hono API** (`trunorth/server/`), configure env vars from
  `trunorth/.env.example`, verify health + `/api/companion` in production, and share
  the test URL (demo mode: `?demo=1`) with the team.

### Vandy — Product management (research & game vision)

- [x] ~~Deliver Level 1 script~~ — [`docs/scripts/Scene, script, players.docx`](./docs/scripts/Scene,%20script,%20players.docx)
  (The Singing Bridge: Flicker, Wize, Courage Feather) — done; superseded 2026-07-18 by
  [`docs/scripts/Updated-Script-6-8anxiety .docx`](./docs/scripts/Updated-Script-6-8anxiety%20.docx)
  (The Little Dragon Who Wouldn't Stop Guarding), now the integrated Level 1 content.
- [ ] Research how existing SEL products — especially **GoZen!** — teach hard emotional
  skills to kids, and turn findings into vision for Levels 2+ (still feed Ermoni/Gabby
  for art, and Daniel for scene scripting).

### Ranya — Product management (research & testing criteria)

- [ ] Research (alongside Vandy) how programs like **GoZen!** teach emotional skills
  through simple formats, and translate findings into **test criteria for Level 1**:
  what “good” looks like when playing The Little Dragon Who Wouldn't Stop Guarding on
  this basic 2D DOM game (attention, clarity of choices, emotional beat landing, Star
  Crystal payoff).

### Madhu — Product management (PR support & spec alignment)

- [ ] Provide continuous support across the team: help review and shepherd pull
  requests, and make sure work stays aligned with
  `docs/specs/TruNorth Technical Specification.md` (intent) and **this `product.md`** (what’s built).
  Prefer PRs that update `product.md` in the same change when files/behavior move.

---

## 0. How to use and maintain this file (read before editing)

These rules exist so `product.md` stays trustworthy and consistent across every pull request.

1. **This file describes reality, not intent.** The technical specification says what the
   product *should* be; `product.md` records what has *actually been built*. If it isn't
   in the repo and working, it does not get a "done" description here.

2. **Update it in the same change set as the code.** Any PR that adds, removes, or changes
   a file, method, or behavior in `trunorth/` must update the matching section here in the
   same PR. Treat an out-of-date `product.md` as a broken build.

3. **Keep entries short and factual.** For each implemented file: its path, its purpose in
   one line, and its key exports (functions/classes/methods) with a one-line description
   each. No design rationale, no future plans — those live in the spec.

4. **Never delete an empty section.** `⬜` is a truthful signal that nothing is built
   there yet. Sections grow from `⬜` → `🟨` → `✅` as real code lands.

5. **Offload depth to context files.** When an entry would exceed ~15 lines or needs
   tables/diagrams/method-by-method walkthroughs, move the detail to
   [`docs/context/`](./docs/context/)`<area>-<subject>.md` (the file states which sources
   it documents at the top), keep a one-line summary + link here, and add a row to
   Section 4.

6. **Mirror the real folder structure.** Section 2 must always reflect the actual
   directory tree of `trunorth/`.

7. **Status legend** (use these consistently):
   - `⬜ Not implemented` — scaffolding only, or doesn't exist yet.
   - `🟨 Partial` — some functionality exists; note what's missing.
   - `✅ Implemented` — built and working; describe methods/functionality.

8. **When this file and the spec disagree:** this file wins for "what is built"; the spec
   wins for "what is intended."
   **Repo layout note (2026-07-13):** older drafts referred to `TruNorthProject/` with
   TileMap / Vercel `api/` / rAF loop. That tree is not in this repository. The working
   app is `trunorth/` (DOM scenes + Hono server). Do not reintroduce phantom folders.

| Overall implementation status | **🟨 Playable MVP, DOM-scene model.** Two child levels, both grid-backed (**ch1 Everbright Meadow**, **ch2 The Little Dragon Who Wouldn't Stop Guarding golden path W1→W7** — Wize is the guiding companion, Flicker the dragon physically blocks the path until the final walk-to-stage finish; ch3 forest removed 2026-07-17) + parent coach entry; scene engine with multi-tap/repair; **WASD/arrow world movement with collision, companion follow, collectibles**; **parameterized 100×100 grid levels (per-cell color + walkability, canvas background, center-point collision) — every scene binds a grid via `gridMapId` (6 grids: everbright-meadow, singing-bridge [orphaned], forest-of-questions, meadow-of-curiosity, cave-of-purpose, mountain-festival), hub cards show grid thumbnails**; companion safety filters + demo/live clients; counselor insights + Together Mode (co-play discuss prompts); **cross-device Play Together invites (shareable 4-letter code / `?invite=` link, SQLite-backed rooms, SSE live updates, mobile/LAN dev support — see [play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md))**; **pre-level check-in (3 open-ended questions → 0–10 starting point + bright/steady/gentle placement, fed into journey reflection)**; **declarative stage objects (grid-cell-placed interactables: multi-page dialogs + finish lines that advance/complete a stage — pure JSON authoring)**; local/demo persistence; **Hono API with parent auth, child profiles, remote-progress endpoints (server-built, client not wired), companion + reflect + together routes, SQLite**; Docker; 37 unit tests + content validate. **Not built:** Supabase assets, hosted deploy, client remote sync, e2e/red-team suites, JSON-Schema CI, automated tests for Play Together. **Known broken:** `npm run typecheck` fails (6 errors — see §3.14), so CI is red. Art is grid canvases + inline SVG cast (8-bit pixel-art style); zone PNGs remain for celebration + fallback. |

## 3. Implemented components

> Inline entries stay short; deep walkthroughs live in `docs/context/` (Section 4).

### 3.0 Configuration (`src/config/`, `server/config.ts`, `.env.example`)
✅ Implemented. Runtime tunables via `.env` / `VITE_*`:
- `src/config/app.ts` — `appConfig` (apiUrl via `resolveApiUrl()` getter — prefers the
  same-origin proxy off localhost so LAN/phone play reaches the API, feature flags incl.
  `worldMovement`/`togetherMode`, gameplay defaults Flicker/ch2/w1/age-band 5-7, timing,
  world-movement tunables), `isDemoMode()`.
- `src/config/content.ts` — `contentConfig`: zone metadata (`ZoneConfig[]` — `forest`
  repurposed for ch2's new narrative, `meadow` for ch1, `mountain` unused/decorative),
  achievement checklist, celebration copy (Star Crystal / Sky Festival, `mountain.png`).
- `src/config/gameState.ts` — `createInitialGameState(demoMode)` from `appConfig.defaults`.
- `server/config.ts` — dependency-free `.env` loader + `serverConfig`
  (port/CORS/JWT/db path/companion model+floor+timeout).

### 3.1 Application entry (`src/main.ts`)
✅ Implemented. Detects demo mode (`?demo` / `VITE_DEMO_MODE`), wires
`LocalProgressStore` vs `DemoProgressStore` and Live vs Demo companion clients, navigates
landing → trust → onboarding → hub → **check-in** → game, starts `SceneEngine`,
celebration → parent gate → journey reflection. The `checkin` screen (between hub card
select and `startScenario`) stores its `CheckinRecord` in `progress.checkins[chapterId]`
and raises `flags.lastSafetyFlag` on a flagged typed answer. Attaches/detaches `worldRuntime` per screen; `beginEncounter`
freezes movement on trigger interact; collect pickups award crystals + persist. Together
Mode co-play step machine. **Play Together invites:** landing's "Play Together" button (or
a `?invite=CODE` URL) routes through new `togetherLobby` → `togetherSetup` →
`togetherWaiting` screens before `hub`; `togetherPlayers` state feeds `renderGameView`'s
badge list — see [play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md).
Registers `/sw.js` in prod builds — **file doesn't exist**, so registration silently no-ops.

### 3.2 Scene engine (`src/engine/SceneEngine.ts`, `DecisionResolver.ts`)
✅ Implemented — **click/trigger DOM scenes** (not tile-walking). Lifecycle detail:
[engine-runtime.md](./docs/context/engine-runtime.md).

- `SceneEngine` — loadScene (narration auto-advance; skipped when the scene has a
  finish/advance stage object), startDecision/triggerEncounter,
  submitChoice/submitTyped, multi-tap progress (`MULTI_TAP_REQUIRED`: dp_breathe ×5,
  dp_crossing ×4), repair loops, chapter-complete → celebration, companion + counselor
  callbacks, input freeze during companion calls. Public finish-object paths:
  `advanceScene(targetSceneId?)` and idempotent `completeChapter()` → celebration
  (see [world-stage-objects.md](./docs/context/world-stage-objects.md)).
- `DecisionResolver` — `resolveChoice` (option → band), `applyConsequence` (meter
  fill/level-ups, brownie points, 200-entry event log, repairAction, next scene).
  Also exports `canUsePlayfulExternalization` (unused by callers).

### 3.3 World movement (`src/engine/WorldRuntime.ts`, `Collision.ts`, `src/input/InputController.ts`)
✅ Implemented (DOM stage free-roam, not a tile grid) — see
[world-movement.md](./docs/context/world-movement.md).
- `worldRuntime` singleton — rAF loop, avatar movement with axis-separated AABB collision
  vs NPC feet boxes (default 70×42, per-character `solidSize` override — ch2 Flicker uses
  190×80 to seal the bridge) + walk bounds, companion lag-follow, collectible pickup,
  proximity interact (E/Space/Enter) with hints; feature-flagged `VITE_FEATURE_WORLD_MOVEMENT`.
  Proximity targets are a union: trigger zones → **stage objects** → NPC fallback
  (`onObjectInteract` callback) — see
  [world-stage-objects.md](./docs/context/world-stage-objects.md).
- `Collision.ts` — pure AABB helpers, `moveWithCollision` (wall sliding), walk bands.
- `InputController` — WASD/arrows hold-polling, one-shot interact; clickable trigger
  hotspots remain as fallback.
- **Grid levels** (`GridMap.ts`, `src/content/gridLevels.ts`,
  `src/render/gridBackground.ts`) — parameterized 100×100 cell grid (flat vector:
  coordinate + color + walkable per cell), painted-level builders (6 registered:
  `everbright-meadow` ← ch1; `forest-of-questions`/`meadow-of-curiosity`/
  `cave-of-purpose`/`mountain-festival` ← ch2 w1–w7; `singing-bridge` — orphaned since
  the ch2 narrative swap, no scene binds it, kept as a reference build), canvas
  background + hub thumbnails (`createGridThumbnail`), center-point collision in
  `WorldRuntime`. **Every scene JSON sets `gridMapId`** — grids are the levels now; URL
  `?grid=<id>` (+`&gridDebug=1`) still overrides for testing. See
  [world-grid-levels.md](./docs/context/world-grid-levels.md).
⬜ Not in repo: `SceneGraph`, `EmotionalResidue` modules.

### 3.4 Rendering (`src/render/characters.ts`)
🟨 Partial — inline SVG cast in **8-bit pixel-art style** (ASCII pixel maps →
`<rect>` grids with `shape-rendering="crispEdges"`), no separate sprite/manifest pipeline.
- `renderFullBodyCharacter(opts)` — avatar (skin-tone aware), **Flicker** (red Guardian
  Dragon; id/assetRef containing "flicker" resolves to the dragon, used for the ch2
  bridge-blocker NPC), **Wize** owl mentor, fox/sprite companion archetypes, helper
  animals, worry cloud, grown-up, NPCs; `ExpressionKey` mapping from scene `expression`
  strings.
  Expressions rendered as pixel overlays (eyes/brows/mouth, worry sparks, happy sparkles).
⬜ Not in repo: Viewport layers, SceneRenderer, BubbleManager, ParticleSystem as separate
modules (bubbles/HUD live in `GameView` + CSS).

### 3.5 UI & parent surfaces (`src/ui/`)
✅ Implemented — see [ui-screens-views.md](./docs/context/ui-screens-views.md).
- `GameView.ts` — `renderGameView` (stage, HUD meters, characters, triggers, collectibles,
  **stage objects** (emoji sprites, click fallback) + **`renderDialogOverlay`**
  (multi-page speaker dialog — see
  [world-stage-objects.md](./docs/context/world-stage-objects.md)),
  counselor panel (draggable via its header handle, ✕ to dismiss; position + dismissal
  survive re-renders, a dismissed insight returns when a new one arrives),
  decision overlay with Together Mode 2-step flow
  (narration bar removed 2026-07-18 — `scene.narration` is no longer displayed;
  stage-object dialogs carry story text; engine auto-advance timing unchanged);
  **stage z-layering** so no dialogue is ever blocked by a character:
  characters ≤ ~64 < counselor panel 70 < speaking character + bubble / interact hint 75
  < thinking pill 80 < modal overlays 100;
  **everything on the stage scales with viewport size** — the stage is a CSS size
  container exposing `--px` = 1 design px, characters set `--char-size` and their SVGs
  fill it, text uses `clamp()` legibility floors),
  `renderCelebration` (Star Crystal), `renderJourneyReflection`, `renderParentGate`
  (4-digit PIN, SHA-256 hash in localStorage, 3-fail lockout), `renderTrustScreen`.
  `renderGameView`'s last param, `togetherPlayers: TogetherPlayer[]`, renders a small
  badge row (name/role/accent color) next to the "Playing Together" pill — see
  [play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md).
- `screens.ts` — `renderLanding`, `renderAuthForm` (parent login/register),
  `renderOnboarding` (archetype/name/avatar; default **Flicker**), `renderScenarioHub`
  (child cards use grid canvas thumbnails when the start scene binds a grid; PNG fallback),
  `renderCheckin` (pre-level check-in cards + compass result; skippable — see
  [ui-screens-views.md](./docs/context/ui-screens-views.md)).
  Known issue: its local `Screen` type includes `"dashboard"`, which `main.ts` rejects
  (typecheck error).
- `togetherScreens.ts` — **new.** `renderTogetherLobby` (host/join-by-code),
  `renderTogetherPlayerSetup` (name/color/character picker), `renderTogetherWaiting`
  (code/link + live seat status via SSE/polling) — see
  [play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md).
- `auth.ts` — session token helpers (`getToken`/`setSession`/`clearSession`),
  `apiLogin`/`apiRegister`, `hashPin`/`verifyPin` (WebCrypto SHA-256).
- Together Mode discuss prompts (same-browser co-play, distinct from Play Together
  invites): `counselor/coPlay.ts`.

### 3.6 AI companion client (`src/companion/CompanionClient.ts`)
✅ Implemented — see [safety-companion-pipeline.md](./docs/context/safety-companion-pipeline.md).
- `LiveCompanionClient` — POST `{API}/api/companion` with optional bearer token.
- `DemoCompanionClient` — offline bundle lookup `{scene}:{dp}:{band}` + keyword band
  inference for typed lines; always attaches counselor insight tips.

### 3.7 Safety (`src/safety/filters.ts`)
✅ Implemented. `filterInput` (jailbreak/distress/PII/profanity/length),
`filterOutput` (clinical/meetup blocklist), `sanitizeChildInput`, `escapeHtml`.
Used by unit tests and the server companion route.

### 3.8 Progress store (`src/store/ProgressStore.ts`)
✅ Implemented (MVP).
- `LocalProgressStore` — `trunorth_save_v1` in localStorage (load/save/clear/appendEvent).
- `DemoProgressStore` — in-memory.
- ⬜ Client `RemoteProgressStore` not built — note the **server** already exposes
  `GET/PUT /api/progress/:childId` (§3.11); nothing in the client calls it yet.

### 3.9 Counselor layer (`src/counselor/`)
✅ Implemented.
- `insights.ts` — `insightForStep(dpId, band)` (hand-written coaching for **all 10 DPs**
  × 3 bands + generic fallback; 2 are legacy ch3 DPs kept as library data),
  `buildJourneyReflection(state)` (summary, strengths, growth edges, per-step insights,
  parent coaching), `childFacingLine`.
- `coPlay.ts` — `discussPrompt(dpId)` Together-Mode conversation starters (all 10 DPs).
- `checkin.ts` — pre-level check-in: `CHECKIN_QUESTIONS` bank (6 open-ended questions,
  tappable 0–2-pt options + own-words path), `questionsForChapter` (3 per chapter,
  deterministic rotation), `scoreTypedCheckinAnswer` (sanitize + `filterInput` + feeling-word
  heuristic; distress → 0 pts + flag), `buildCheckinResult` (0–10 starting point,
  bright/steady/gentle placement; answer text never stored), placement labels/companion
  lines. `buildJourneyReflection` appends the baseline to its summary + parent coaching.

### 3.10 Shared types (`src/types/index.ts`)
✅ Implemented. GameState, Scene (`SceneCharacter` has optional `solidSize` [w, h]
collision-footprint override), DecisionPoint, companion request/response, ScenarioMeta,
PlayMode, ProgressStore interface, AuthUser/ChildProfile, `CheckinRecord`/`CheckinPlacement`
(+ optional `progress.checkins` map), **`StageObject`/`StageObjectInteraction`
(discriminated union: openDialog | finish) + `DialogRecord`/`DialogPage` + optional
`Scene.objects`**, factories
`createDefaultMeters` (7 skills). Defaults: companion **Flicker**, chapter `ch2`, scene `w1`.

### 3.11 Server API (`server/`)
✅ Implemented locally (not yet hosted) — full endpoint walkthrough:
[server-api.md](./docs/context/server-api.md). Companion pipeline detail:
[safety-companion-pipeline.md](./docs/context/safety-companion-pipeline.md).

> 🔧 **Jose** — production hosting for this Hono server + static client.
- `api/[[...route]].ts` — Vercel Node.js Function (`export const runtime = "nodejs"`,
  required so `better-sqlite3` works) using `hono/vercel`'s `handle(app)` to forward every
  `/api/*` path to the unchanged Hono `app`; catch-all filename so one function serves all
  routes. **Requires `DATABASE_PATH=/tmp/trunorth.db`** (or similar) as a Vercel env var —
  the project filesystem is read-only outside `/tmp`, so the default `./data/trunorth.db`
  would crash every cold start (`db/migrate.ts` opens the file at module load). This makes
  parent-auth/children/progress non-persistent across cold starts on Vercel, which is
  currently fine because the client doesn't call those endpoints yet (§3.8); wiring real
  persistence needs a serverless-compatible DB swap (Vercel Postgres/Neon or Turso
  libSQL), a separate task from this adapter.
- `index.ts` — `GET /api/health`; **parent auth** `register`/`login`/`me` (bcrypt + JWT);
  **child profiles** `GET/POST /api/children`; **remote progress** `GET/PUT
  /api/progress/:childId` (parent-owned, upsert; no client caller yet); audit-log writes;
  CORS is now a dynamic origin function (was a static list) — allows `serverConfig.corsOrigins`
  plus any `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/LAN-IP (`192.168.x`/`10.x`/`172.16–31.x`) origin, so a
  phone on `http://192.168.x.x:5173` can reach the API for Play Together.
- `routes/companion.ts` — `POST /api/companion`: input filter → Anthropic (if key) or
  local heuristic score → confidence floor → output filter → fallbacks library;
  `POST /api/reflect`: event list → counselor insights (no client caller yet).
- `routes/together.ts` — **new.** Play Together invite rooms: `POST /api/together/rooms`
  (create, returns a 4-letter code), `GET /api/together/rooms/:code`, `POST
  /api/together/rooms/:code/join`, `POST /api/together/rooms/:code/close`, `GET
  /api/together/rooms/:code/stream` (SSE). No auth — guest-friendly, 2-hour TTL. See
  [play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md).
- `auth/jwt.ts` — `signToken`/`verifyToken` (jose HS256, 7-day expiry).
- `db/migrate.ts` — SQLite schema: parents, child_profiles, progress, audit_logs,
  `together_rooms` (WAL).
- ⬜ No Vercel `api/` tree in this repo.

### 3.12 Content (`content/`)
✅ Implemented (draft; SME review still pending). Every scene sets `gridMapId`, so both
levels play on grid backgrounds (§3.3); hub shows only these two + parent coach.
Scenes may declare **stage objects** (`objects[]`: grid-cell interactables → dialog or
finish line) and **dialogs** (`dlg_*.json`, registered in `DIALOGS`): ch1 has a welcome
signpost (e1), a North Gate finish/advance (e2 — replaces its auto-advance timer), and a
Celebration Arch finish/complete (e3, alternate to `dp_ask_grownup`); ch2 has Wize's
star-legend scroll (w1) and the ✅ Level Complete finish (w7). Authoring guide:
[world-stage-objects.md](./docs/context/world-stage-objects.md).
- **Ch.2 The Little Dragon Who Wouldn't Stop Guarding (golden path, grids
  `forest-of-questions`/`meadow-of-curiosity`/`cave-of-purpose`/`mountain-festival`,
  ages 5–7):** explorer Nova collects Star Crystals for the Sky Festival with Flicker, an
  overprotective Guardian Dragon. Wize the owl is the follower companion (assetRef
  `char_wize` on the `companion` id); Flicker stands in the path with a widened
  `solidSize` solid, physically blocking the way through w1–w6.
  w1 quest start (Forest) → w2 curious questions (Forest of Questions) → w3 inspect a
  worry-flower (Meadow of Curiosity) → w4 welcome Flicker beside you (Valley of Welcome,
  5 taps) → w5 thank Flicker's purpose (Cave of Purpose) → w6 festival steps (Mountain of
  Helpers, 4 taps) → w7 Flicker steps aside, player walks to the Sky Festival stage's ✅
  finish/complete checkmark → Star Crystal celebration. DPs: `dp_quest_start`,
  `dp_investigate`, `dp_fact_sort`, `dp_breathe`, `dp_choose_path`, `dp_crossing`
  (no longer a chapter-complete decision — `CHAPTER_COMPLETE_DECISION` is ch1-only).
  **Superseded 2026-07-18:** the original Singing Bridge script (Flicker/Wize, river
  crossing, Courage Feather, grid `singing-bridge`) — see the team-board Daniel entry and
  §6 changelog for why (a stale unrebased branch reconciled forward rather than merged).
- **Ch.1 Everbright Meadow (grid `everbright-meadow`):** e1–e3, 2 DPs.
- **Ch.3 Forest removed 2026-07-17** (files deleted, registry/scenario/hub entries
  dropped). Its 2 DPs remain only as library data in insights/coPlay/fallbacks.
- `fallbacks/companion-fallbacks.json` — 10 DPs × strong/partial/poor/timeout/safety
  (8 registered + 2 legacy ch3).
- `demo/showcase.bundle.json` — 10 canned responses keyed `{scene}:{dp}:{band}`.
- ⬜ `content/schema/` Ajv pack, `content/rubrics/` — not present.
- ⬜ Per-scene `tileMap` rooms — not used (scenes use `gridMapId` + `triggers`).

### 3.13 Assets (`public/assets/`)
🟨 Partial. Zone PNGs (meadow/forest/cave/mountain) under `public/assets/zones/`;
characters are code-drawn 8-bit pixel SVG (see §3.4); `favicon.svg` is a matching
8-bit compass star. Ch2's zone card + celebration reuse `forest.png`/`mountain.png`
(no dedicated forest/cave/mountain-path art for the 4 new ch2 grids yet). No
`assets-src/` provenance pipeline.

> 🔧 **Ermoni & Gabby** — Level 1 art + Supabase delivery (offline fallback required).

### 3.14 Build & tooling
🟨 Partial.
- `scripts/validate-content.ts` — walks chapter JSON for id/chapterId/emotionalArc/
  consequences, plus dialog files (`dlg_*`: id/chapterId/non-empty pages) and scene
  `objects[]` (unique ids, 0–99 cells, resolvable dialog/finish targets) — two-pass,
  still no Ajv schemas. **Passing** as of 2026-07-17.
- `npm run test:unit` — **37/37 passing**. `npm run build` — **passing** (vite build;
  server tsc errors are swallowed by `|| true`).
- **`npm run typecheck` — FAILING (6 errors), which makes CI red:**
  5 × TS2352 in `src/content/index.ts` (scene JSON `position: number[]` doesn't satisfy
  `[number, number]` for the `as Scene` casts; was 9 before the ch2 narrative rewrite
  changed which scenes' character arrays mix `solidSize`-bearing and plain shapes) and
  1 × TS2345 in `src/main.ts` (`screens.ts` `Screen` includes `"dashboard"`, not in
  `AppScreen`).
  Script is now `tsc --noEmit && tsc -p tsconfig.api.json` — the second pass covers both
  `server/` and the new `api/` (see below) via **`tsconfig.api.json`** (`noEmit: true`,
  extends `tsconfig.server.json`); a separate config was needed because adding `api/` to
  `tsconfig.server.json` itself trips `TS6059` (`api/[[...route]].ts` sits outside its
  `rootDir: "server"`) whenever something actually emits — `noEmit: true` sidesteps that,
  and `tsconfig.server.json` (used by the Docker build's `--noEmit false` pass) is
  untouched.
- `npm run lint` — broken: no `eslint.config.js` (flat config) for ESLint v9; the
  `api/` directory it targets now exists (2026-07-17) but the missing config file is the
  actual blocker.
- **Known quirk (left as-is on purpose):** the server pass of `npm run build`
  (`tsc -p tsconfig.server.json --noEmit false`) emits stray `.js` files **into `src/`**
  for client files the server imports (`src/types/index.js`, `src/safety/filters.js`,
  `src/counselor/{insights,checkin}.js`) because `rootDir: "server"` puts them outside
  `dist-server`. These strays silently **shadow the `.ts` sources** in vitest and vite
  (all imports use `.js` extensions) — if tests/dev ignore your edits after a build,
  delete `src/**/*.js` strays. **Never commit them.** This whole build path is interim
  and will be replaced when the proper hosted API/backend build lands (Jose's deploy
  task) — don't invest in fixing it.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): typecheck → validate:content → test:unit → build.
- ⬜ `build-asset-manifest`, `red-team-suite`, `audit-bundle-size` — not in tree.
- ⬜ Playwright e2e — `test:e2e` script + devDependency exist; **no `tests/e2e` folder or
  playwright config**.

### 3.15 Tests (`tests/`)
🟨 Partial — **37 tests, all passing**: `tests/unit/engine.test.ts` (13 — DecisionResolver
bands/meters/repair, safety filters, Little Dragon golden-path presence, ch3 absence,
counselor insights + journey reflection, SVG cast rendering, world collision wall slide +
bounds) + `tests/unit/grid.test.ts` (8 — grid cell vector, painting/world lookup,
center-point slide, level registry, `?grid=` resolution, scenario/scene→grid routing,
legacy `singing-bridge` river crossing (grid still registered though orphaned),
Flicker-solid path block on w6's own `gridMapId` vs clear in w7) +
`tests/unit/checkin.test.ts` (6 — question rotation, typed
feeling-word scoring, distress flag, placement bands, labels/lines, reflection baseline)
+ `tests/unit/stageObjects.test.ts` (10 — cell→world parity, object placement/sprites,
object/dialog content integrity incl. ch2 w7-checkmark completion,
advanceScene/completeChapter, auto-advance suppression).
⬜ integration / e2e / red-team folders. ⬜ No tests yet for Play Together (§3.16).

### 3.16 Play Together invites (`server/routes/together.ts`, `src/together/`, `src/ui/togetherScreens.ts`)
✅ Implemented (no auth, 2-hour room TTL, no automated tests yet). Cross-device
alternative to the same-browser "Together Mode" toggle: a parent and child join the same
playthrough from different devices via a shareable 4-letter code or `?invite=CODE` link,
backed by SQLite rooms + SSE live updates, with a localStorage fallback when the API is
unreachable. Ships alongside LAN/mobile support (`vite.config.ts` `host:true`,
`resolveApiUrl()` same-origin preference, `viewport-fit=cover`). Full detail:
[play-together-invites.md](./docs/context/play-together-invites.md).

## 6. Recent changelog (ledger)

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-13 | Rebased this ledger onto real `trunorth/` tree (removed phantom `TruNorthProject/` claims). |
| 2026-07-13 | Integrated Level 1 **The Singing Bridge** (W1–W6, Flicker, Wize, Courage Feather). |
| 2026-07-13 | Updated team board: Daniel L1 done; Ermoni/Gabby/Jose/Vandy/Ranya tasks retargeted. |
| 2026-07-13 | Organized repo into `docs/{specs,scripts,kickoff,context}`; added configurable `server/config.ts`, `src/config/*`, expanded `.env.example`. |
| 2026-07-14 | Added world movement: WASD/arrows, collision, proximity interact (E/Space), companion follow, collectible pickup (`WorldRuntime`). |
| 2026-07-17 | Full reality audit: documented server auth/children/progress/reflect endpoints, world movement promoted to ✅, test count 11→13, recorded failing typecheck (CI red), broken lint script, missing `sw.js`; added context files `world-movement.md`, `ui-screens-views.md`, `server-api.md`. |
| 2026-07-17 | Added parameterized 100×100 grid levels: `GridMap` (cell vector: coordinate/color/walkable, painting API), `gridLevels.ts` (2 demo levels, `?grid=<id>` testing), canvas `gridBackground.ts`, center-point grid collision in `WorldRuntime`, optional `Scene.gridMapId`; tests 13→19; context file `world-grid-levels.md`. |
| 2026-07-17 | Made grid levels the only levels: all ch1/ch2 scenes bind `gridMapId` (everbright-meadow / singing-bridge), hub cards render grid canvas thumbnails, ch1 scenario retitled "Everbright Meadow"; **removed ch3 Forest** (content files + registry + hub card + default unlock); tests 19→20; typecheck errors 11→9. |
| 2026-07-17 | Added **pre-level check-in**: hub → `checkin` screen before every level (3 open-ended questions from a 6-question bank, tap or own-words answers, safety-filtered) → 0–10 starting point + bright/steady/gentle placement stored in `progress.checkins`, shown on a compass scale, and surfaced in the parent journey reflection. New `src/counselor/checkin.ts`, `renderCheckin`; tests 20→26. **Deleted committed stale compiled JS (`src/counselor/insights.js`, `src/safety/filters.js`, `src/types/index.js`)** — they silently shadowed the `.ts` sources in vitest and vite builds. Root cause: the server build pass emits into `src/` (documented as a known quirk in §3.14; left as-is until the proper hosted API/backend build replaces it). |
| 2026-07-17 | Added Vercel deploy scaffolding: `api/[[...route]].ts` (Node Function wrapping the existing Hono `app` via `hono/vercel`'s `handle()`, catch-all so one function serves every `/api/*` route) + `tsconfig.api.json` (typecheck-only config covering `server/`+`api/` without disturbing the Docker build's `tsconfig.server.json`); `npm run typecheck`'s second pass now uses it. Code-side only — the actual Vercel project (root dir, env vars incl. `DATABASE_PATH=/tmp/...`, deploy) is still a manual step for whoever holds the Vercel account. |
| 2026-07-17 | Recreated the full character cast (`src/render/characters.ts`) + `public/favicon.svg` in 8-bit pixel-art style: ASCII pixel maps rendered as crisp SVG `<rect>` grids, pixel expression overlays (brows/mouth/sparks/sparkles). Same exports, sizes, and aspect ratios — no caller changes. |
| 2026-07-17 | Made the whole game stage scale with the screen (characters were fixed 110/120px while the stage shrank): `.game-viewport` is now a CSS size container defining `--px` (1/1920 of stage width); characters get a `--char-size` var in `GameView` and their SVGs fill it (`width:100%; height:auto`); labels, speech bubbles, collectibles, move/interact hints, HUD meters, pills, zone sign, narration bar all sized in `calc(n * var(--px))` with `clamp()` legibility floors on text. Verified at 1600/700/480px windows — avatar:stage ratio constant 0.0573. `src/styles/global.css` + `src/ui/GameView.ts` only. |
| 2026-07-18 | Made the SEL Coach insight panel draggable + closable (`GameView.ts` + `global.css` only): new `.counselor-panel-header` (badge + ✕) acts as a pointer-capture drag handle with window-clamped inline `left/top`; ✕ dismisses. Module-scope state keeps the dragged position and the dismissed-insight key across the full re-renders `renderGameView` does each phase/meter update — a dismissed insight stays hidden until a different insight arrives. |
| 2026-07-18 | Fixed dialogs being blocked by characters + removed the bottom narration bar (`GameView.ts` + `global.css` only): characters (z up to ~64 from `10 + y/20`) were punching through the decision/dialog `.overlay` (was z 30) and standing on the counselor panel (was z 25). New stage z-layering: counselor panel 70, speaking character + bubble / interact hint 75, thinking pill 80, modal overlays 100. Companion speech bubble restyled (wider `360*--px` max, border, tail, 11px floor). Narration bar deleted — `scene.narration` no longer renders (stage-object dialogs carry story text; `SceneEngine` auto-advance untouched). Also de-overlapped top pills: stage tag drops below the demo pill, together-pill below the crystal counter; move hint moved to bottom-left. Verified in-browser (w1→w3 + scroll dialog); 36/36 tests, typecheck still 9 known errors. |
| 2026-07-17 | Added **declarative stage objects** (groundwork for the anxiety level & infinite stage authoring): `Scene.objects[]` — grid-cell-placed interactables with a `StageObjectInteraction` union (`openDialog` → new multi-page `renderDialogOverlay` with speaker/portrait, fed by `dlg_*.json` + `DIALOGS` registry; `finish` → new public `SceneEngine.advanceScene`/`completeChapter`, with `advance`\|`complete` per object). WorldRuntime proximity now targets triggers → objects → NPC fallback (`onObjectInteract`); objects render as emoji sprites with click fallback; narration auto-advance is skipped when a finish/advance object exists. Demo content: ch1 signpost/North Gate/Celebration Arch, ch2 w1 Wize scroll (ch2 finale untouched). validate-content now checks dialogs + objects; tests 26→36. Verified in-browser (dialog paging/freeze, gate advance, arch celebration, no auto-advance). New context file `world-stage-objects.md`. |
| 2026-07-18 | Removed Flicker's detached orange wing pixels (`O: #ff9e00`) from `dragonSvg` in `src/render/characters.ts` — the floating triangles read as a stray orange mouse cursor next to the companion in-game; body/belly widened one column to fill the gap. Art-only, no export changes. |
| 2026-07-18 | **Fixed the Wize/Flicker role swap in Level 1 + walk-to-finish ending.** Ch2 scenes now cast **Wize the owl as the follower companion** (assetRef `char_wize` on the `companion` id; GameView labels/pill say "Wize" whenever the scene's companion assetRef is wize) and **Flicker the dragon as a stationary NPC blocking the Singing Bridge** (new `flicker` id → dragon sprite mapping in `characters.ts`; new optional `SceneCharacter.solidSize` [w,h] lets his solid span the whole 154px plank corridor, 190×80 at the south entrance in w1–w6). Chapter completion is no longer decision-driven: `dp_crossing` strong now advances to **new scene w7**, where Flicker stands aside and a ✅ "Level Complete" `finish/complete` stage object sits on the north bank — the player physically crosses the bridge and presses E to end the level (ch2 removed from `CHAPTER_COMPLETE_DECISION`; `GOLDEN_PATH`/`CHAPTER_FINALE` updated; new `finish_check` sprite). Script text unchanged. Tests 36→37 (bridge-block collision test; ch2 finale guard rewritten for w7); verified end-to-end in headless Chromium (blocked at bridge in w1, full W1→W7 play-through, checkmark → Courage Feather celebration). |
| 2026-07-18 | **Rebased Level 1 onto the new 5–7 anxiety script ("The Little Dragon Who Wouldn't Stop Guarding") + shipped cross-device Play Together invites, reconciling a stale unrebased branch instead of merging it.** Daniel's `feat/singing-bridge-level-1` (PR #7) had branched off main on 2026-07-14, before the w7 finish, Wize/Flicker role fix, dialogue z-layering fix, stage objects, and SEL coach panel landed — so its own independent Level 1 rewrite collided with all of that on the same files (`GitHub: CONFLICTING`). Resolution was a fresh branch off main with the PR's changes manually re-applied rather than a git merge: **content** — all `content/chapters/ch2/dp_*.json` + `w1–w6.scene.json` replaced 1:1 on the same DP ids with the new narrative (explorer Nova, Flicker, Star Crystals, Sky Festival), `config/content.ts` zones/achievements/celebration, `content/scenarios.ts` ch2 metadata, `counselor/{coPlay,insights}.ts`, `content/{demo/showcase.bundle,fallbacks/companion-fallbacks}.json`, `src/ui/screens.ts` onboarding line, `src/engine/SceneEngine.ts` multi-tap/repair companion lines — all updated to match; **preserved unchanged** — the w7 walk-to-finish stage-object mechanic (new `w7.scene.json` + `dlg_star_legend.json` replacing `dlg_bridge_legend.json`; `dp_crossing` strong band now targets w7), the Wize/Flicker character-role split (reapplied to every new scene), the dialogue z-layering fix, speech/voice toggle, and declarative stage objects; **new** — 4 grid maps (`forest-of-questions`, `meadow-of-curiosity`, `cave-of-purpose`, `mountain-festival` in `gridLevels.ts`) so the explorable-grid feature keeps working per-biome instead of the single `singing-bridge` grid (now orphaned but left registered). **Play Together** (additive, not part of the conflict): new `server/routes/together.ts` (SQLite `together_rooms`, create/join/get/close/SSE-stream), `src/together/inviteStore.ts`, `src/ui/togetherScreens.ts`, `src/util/id.ts`; wired into `main.ts` (new `togetherLobby`/`togetherSetup`/`togetherWaiting` screens, `?invite=CODE` bootstrap) and `GameView.ts` (player badges); LAN/mobile support (`vite.config.ts` `host:true`, `config/app.ts` `resolveApiUrl()`, `index.html` `viewport-fit=cover`, dynamic CORS origin in `server/index.ts`). New context file `play-together-invites.md`. ch1/ch3 and Daniel's role-fix/z-layering work are untouched. Tests: `tests/unit/grid.test.ts`'s bridge-block test rewritten to read `w6`'s own `gridMapId` and relative offsets instead of hardcoded Singing-Bridge pixel positions; 37/37 passing, `validate:content` passing, typecheck 9→6 known errors (narrower `as Scene` JSON-cast mismatch, unrelated to this change). No automated tests yet for Play Together. |
| 2026-07-18 | Fixed a second stray-orange-pixel regression in `dragonSvg` (`src/render/characters.ts`): the "worried" expression's 4 floating worry-sparks were 3× `GOLD` (`#ffd60a`) + 1× a different hardcoded orange (`#ff6b35`), isolated in empty space near the sprite — same "reads as a leftover cursor" bug as the 07-17 wing-pixel fix, just a different pixel. Went unnoticed before because Flicker was rarely "worried"; the new Little Dragon script keeps Flicker worried through nearly every ch2 scene, making it obvious. Changed the odd spark to `GOLD` to match the other three. Art-only, no export changes; 37/37 tests still passing. |
